        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; "> <b>Los Angeles</b></p> 
       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Los Angeles is a trip in America I hoped to go since I was a child. Since my cousins and their parents lived in America, we went with them, and it was an experience I will never forget. For me it was a very enjoyable trip. Even though me and my cousins were exhausted at the end of the day we went to sleep with a smile on our faces.</p>
       <h1>Transport</h1>
        <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Los Angeles was a big place and there was a lot of ground to cover so the best option is to rent a car. Though it might be a bit boring it’s better to rent a car while in Los Angeles.</p>
             


   <h1>San Francisco</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Los Angeles wasn’t the only city I visited in California I had went to San Francisco too. The Golden Bridge of San Francisco was mesmerising and was extremely beautiful. The most appropriate time to see the golden gate bridge is either during sunrise or sunset. The sight I had seen is a sight I will never forget in my life.</p>

    These spots are the places you definitely must visit while going to Los Angeles (and San Francisco) and if you have finished visiting these places then don't worry there are lots of other places to see. I hope you liked this page and found some useful information about Los Angeles. It really was a wonderful experience to travel to these 2 cities especially with my cousins I really enjoyed it and I hope one day you will get to go too.
