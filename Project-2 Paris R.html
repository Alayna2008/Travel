        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; "><b>Paris</b></p>
       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> I went to Paris with my family during the wintertime and it was amazing. Paris is a place for all types of people. If you are an artist then you can see many paintings and other artistic things to see in museums and even there are small shops on the street with beautiful drawings, sketches, and paintings. If you are a person who like shopping then there are plenty of shops for everything. If you are a person who likes history then Paris is the perfect place for you as there is so much history in each spot of Paris.</p>
       <h1>Transport</h1>
        <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">There was lots of things to see in Paris and it would be impossible to visit all of them in a few days. So, what me and my family did was we took the tour buses to each site we had to go. This way we would get glimpses of Paris each time we go .I definitely recommend doing this as even if you won't get time to visit all the stops as your trip might be short at least you will be able to see the glimpses of those places through the bus trip. But if you prefer renting a car as you don't like public buses that's alright too. Another way to explore Paris is by walking. Though it might not be possible to walk to all the attractions walking to nearby places is an amazing way to see Paris. If you are planning a long trip and not too lazy to stretch your legs, then walking is a fantastic way to explore Paris as you can take your time, enjoy the Parisian atmosphere, and click some photos. But if you have a short trip then it is better to use some other mode of transport as there is a lot of ground to cover there.

<h1>Food</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Another thing that is famous in Paris is the food their but specifically the pastries and bakery items. I loved all the pastries that I had in Paris, but my personal favourite was macaroons. When I entered the cafe the aroma itself was mouth-watering. Other than macaroons there was many other delicious things like croissants, baguettes, waffles etc. You must visit a cafe at least once in when you got to Paris.</p>
