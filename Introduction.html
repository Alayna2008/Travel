    <p> Most of us have travelled somewhere, to a nearby country, city or to your homeland. Even in a short drive, you are travelling from your home to some place. Some of us despise travelling. It may be due to many reasons, you may have motion sickness, or you don't like travelling as the trips you experienced were boring or maybe you just don't like to get out of your house. And there are others who love travelling even if it is just to a supermarket. It could be because they like to explore a lot, or they like to experience diverse cultures. However, no matter what type of person you are you will find this website interesting you are a person who dislikes travelling then you can think of it as a medium to travel right from the comfort of your own home. If you are a person who likes travelling, then think of it as a medium to prep up before travelling if you have not explored these places yet. Now on the left side you can see that there are the names of a few places. If you click on one of those places you will enter a page in which you can find some details about those places. On the right side you will see the same names of the places but instead of professional details you will be able to see my personal experience and tips of that place if I have gone there yet. Now go click some buttons and check out the places that feel interesting to you and find how it is like to go there.</p>
