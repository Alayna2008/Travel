        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;"> <b>New Zealand</b></p> 
       <p  style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> New Zealand was a wonderful place with lots of greenery all around. I went during the march and the weather was perfect. We went to 2 main places Auckland and Queenstown. After we arrived in New Zealand, we spent the first few days with my uncle and aunt who live in Auckland and then the four of us went to Queenstown. A particular thing that I noticed is that New Zealand is full of flora and fauna. There was many parks and hills perfect for a picnic day. Queenstownâ€™s hills are the perfect place for peace and quiet and some relaxation. It was a beautiful trip in which I got to see a lot of beautiful sights and enjoyed with my family.</p>
       <h1>Weather</h1>
        <p  style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The march weather was perfect there was a cool breeze while the sun was shining brightly as well. It was the perfect weather and I recommend going in this time.
        </p>
<h1>Transport</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> Since we had our relatives in Auckland, we never needed an extra mode of transportation as they had 2 cars but in Queenstown when it was just the 4 of us we had to rent a car. There was a lot of sites to see in Queenstown we needed a car to travel. There are many hills and mountains in Queenstown so it would be safer if you choose to rent a small car.</p>

   <h1>Food </h1>
       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;" >
        All sorts of food were available, but the one different food (kind of a snack) was meat pies. Nowhere else had I even heard of meat pies. But yes, it was tasty. The pies would be crispy, and the filling would be a mixture of meat, mushrooms, and cheese. If you ever go to New Zealand don't forget to try this takeaway snack.
