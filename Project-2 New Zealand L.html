       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island  and the South Island and more than 700 smaller islands, covering a total area of 268,021 square kilometres . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres  east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres  south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland. </p>

    The Sky Tower is a telecommunications and observation tower in Auckland, New Zealand. Located at the corner of Victoria and Federal Streets within the city's CBD, it is 328 metres  tall, as measured from ground level to the top of the mast, making it the tallest freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere and the 27th tallest tower in the world. It has become an iconic landmark in Auckland's skyline due to its height and design.

    The tower is part of the Sky City Auckland casino complex, originally built in 1994–1997 for Harrah's Entertainment. Several upper levels are accessible to the public, attracting an average of 1,150 visitors per day

<h1>Wanaka Tree</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;" >That Wanaka Tree, also known as the Wanaka Willow, is a willow tree located at the southern end of Lake Wanaka in the Otago region of New Zealand. The tree sits alone in the water and is a popular destination for tourists to take Instagram photos. As a result of its popularity, That Wanaka Tree has been intentionally and unintentionally damaged on several occasions. That Wanaka Tree derives its name from the hashtag "#ThatWanakaTree", which is used on Instagram to identify photos of the tree. The tree has been described as "New Zealand's most famous tree" and called "one of the most photographed trees in all New Zealand." A photograph of the tree by Dennis Rademacher won the 2014 New Zealand Geographic photo of the year award.</p>
