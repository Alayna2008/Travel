       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. It is an incredibly famous place in the travelling world. Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts. Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Paris–Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Metro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily; it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks.</p>
        <h1 >The Eiffel Tower</h1>
        <p  style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Paris is mostly known for its historic landmark: The Eiffel Tower. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair. The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over three hundred steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.

The tower is open to visitors 365 days a year, with visiting times varying by season. From June to September, the tower remains open until after midnight.
