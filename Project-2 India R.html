       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> Now to be honest the reason I chose to tell about Kerala out of all of the other states in India is because Kerala is my homeland . But honestly speaking Kerela is a great place with a few flaws of course but its definitely beautiful and a place you must visit whenever you travel to India.</p>
       <h1>Transport</h1>
        <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">I have many relatives at Kerala, so I never really needed to choose any mode of transport. But if you are a person who has never been to Kerala then its best if you choose to rent a car with a driver. I mean there are many modes of transport in Kerala but the cleanest and most preferable mode of transport for a tourist is renting a car with a driver.
               <p>
<h1>Food</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> Keralites prefer food with lots of spices.So if you go out to try any restraunt in Kerala take a bottle of water .The most eaten food in Kerala is rice.Even breakfast meals are a form of rice and you will always need to buy a curry along with them.Briyani is also a famous lunch food in Kerala and make sure you eat it at least once when you visit.If you are a person who loves spicy food then Keralian food is perfect for your taste.</p>

    These spots are the places you definitely must visit while in Kerala and if you have finished visiting these places then don't worry there are lots of other places to see. I hope you liked this page and found some useful information about Kerala. I really hope you visit Kerala once and experience the southern Indian culture and traditions.
