        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; "> <b>London</b></p> 
       <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> I went to London with my family during the Christmas holidays and it was a magical experience. I loved going to London and it was one of the most exciting places I have ever been. </p>
       <h1>Transport</h1>
        <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Like London what we did was we took the tour buses as it was the cheapest and most sensible mode of transport. And from time to time we also used the metro to return to our hotel. But again, it is completely your wish to choose any mode of transport you like.
               <p>
<h1>Food</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> We already had a complete English breakfast in the morning from our hotel so that is one thing we didn’t need to try in a restaurants there was also another food called fish and chips in London. What I noticed was in almost all of the restaurant’s menu there would be fish and chips. So one day we tried it out and it was something we had never eaten before. It looked almost like fried chicken only it wasn’t.</p>

   <h1>The Christmas Fun</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Like I said I went to London during the Christmas holidays, and I truly felt the Christmas spirit. Everywhere I went I could always see something related to Christmas. Even our hotel was completely decorated with Christmas decorations. There was many Christmas themed carnivals and fun places and you could really feel the christmas spirit.</p>

    These spots are the places you must visit while going to London and if you have finished visiting these places then do not worry there are lots of other places to see. I hope you liked this page and found some useful information about London. I do not know how it’s like in the summer, but I completely recommend going in the winter because during the winter London was completely magical.
